Hello There!
I am a PhD student at the Chair of [Dependable Systems and Software](https://depend.cs.uni-saarland.de/) at Saarland University.

Got my Master's degree at [FAMAF](https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/), Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, in Córdoba, Argentina. My current topics of interest revolve around Probabilistic Risk/Safety Assessment, which involves (all sorts of) Fault Trees, its interaction with stochastic systems, and their industrial use cases. Additionally, I know a bit about IA for NLP, Numerical Theory and Concurrency Theory.
